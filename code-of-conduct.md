## Introduction

The Technology Transformation Service (TTS) is committed to building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for everyone. 

We adhere to the [GSA Anti-harassment Policy](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/512516), which covers forms of harassment from which federal employees are protected as a matter of law. But our standards are higher. We don’t merely want a work environment that's free from hostility; we want one that is actively welcoming and inclusive. We want our team and our workplace culture to reflect and celebrate the diversity of the communities we serve.

This is our Code of Conduct. We expect everyone on the TTS team to exhibit these behaviors. In addition, we expect everyone within TTS spaces to exhibit these behaviors and follow the GSA anti-harassment policy while you are in our spaces. These spaces include:

* TTS’s physical offices,

* TTS events and meetings,

* All of our online forums and virtual collaboration tools, including:

    * Office chat rooms, like Slack

    * Mailing lists and email

    * Code repositories, like GitHub

## What We Strive For

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that empowers people to provide outstanding public service. That kind of atmosphere requires an open exchange of ideas balanced by thoughtful guidelines. If we have only openness, colleagues who are on the receiving end of thoughtless or intentionally hurtful comments and behavior may reasonably withdraw. If we have overly intrusive guidelines, they’ll make people feel unwelcome.

It would be impossible to list everything people can do to create a more welcoming space, and we know this team will find ways to include their colleagues that we haven't even thought of. But when in doubt, we encourage you to look to these principles for guidance:

* Be humble; practice empathy and humility.

* Assume competence in your colleagues, clients and the public.

* Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work for the public.

* Listen carefully and actively.

* Ask questions, and seek to understand your partners’ context.

* Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.

* Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.

## Unacceptable Behavior

To help colleagues understand the kinds of behaviors that are illegal or run counter to the culture we seek to foster, **we’ve listed below actions that violate GSA policy and those that violate TTS policy.** We’ve also included steps to take if you believe a colleague has violated either policy. 

### The [GSA Anti-harassment Policy](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/512516) forbids:

* Sexual harassment and misconduct, as defined in [GSA Order 2325.8 Section 3(b) and 3(c)](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/512516)

* Unwelcome verbal or written comment or physical conduct that is so objectively offensive that it alters the terms or conditions of employment or creates a hostile work environment; when it is based on:

    * race,

    * religion,

    * color,

    * sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping),

    * national origin,

    * age,

    * disability,

    * genetic information,

    * sexual orientation,

    * gender identity,

    * parental status,

    * marital status,

    * or political affiliation.

* Retaliating against anyone who files a formal complaint that someone has violated the GSA anti-harassment policy.

#### How To Report Violations of the GSA Anti-Harassment Policy

All violations of GSA’s anti-harassment policy are also violations of this Code of Conduct, and we encourage you to report them to your supervisor or the TTS Talent team so that TTS can take any necessary steps to ensure that we have a safe and welcoming team.

The reporting process for the GSA’s Anti-Harassment Policy can be found in [GSA Order 2325.8 Section 3(d)](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/512516). Depending on your complaint, you may have a 45-day window from the date of the incident to report it to the GSA. Please read the GSA information carefully. 

### TTS Policy 

TTS adheres to the GSA anti-harassment policy. We also consider the following behavior unacceptable, as it undermines a safe and collaborative workplace for all:

* Negative or offensive remarks based on any of the protected categories listed in the GSA Anti-Harassment policy, as well as negative or offensive remarks based on:

    * gender expression,

    * mental illness,

    * socioeconomic status or background,

    * neuro(a)typicality,

    * physical appearance,

    * body size,

    * or clothing.

* Touching people without their affirmative consent.

* Sustained disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions, including chatrooms.

* Intentionally or repeatedly referring to people in a way that rejects the validity of their gender identity; for instance, by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering).

* Microagressions, which are small comments or questions, either intentional or unintentional, that marginalize people by communicating hostile, derogatory, or negative beliefs. Examples include:

    * Patronizing language or behavior

        * Pedantic corrections that don’t contribute to the conversation (for example, when someone is using "democracy" to mean “participatory government,” saying “Well actually, we’re not a democracy; we’re a democratic republic.”)

        * Assuming without asking that particular people or groups need concepts defined or explained to them. (It’s great to be sensitive to the fact that clients and coworkers may not be familiar with technical or government terms you use every day! But assuming that people are uninformed can come across as patronizing.) 

        * Assuming that particular groups of people are technically unskilled ("So easy your grandmother could do it.") 

    * Repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else

    * Feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic 

    * The use of racially charged language to describe an individual or thing such as "thug" or “ghetto”

    * Referring to an individual in a way that demeans or challenges the validity of their racial identity 

    * Mocking someone’s real or perceived accent or first language.

* Retaliating against anyone who files a complaint that someone has violated this code of conduct.

#### How To Address Code of Conduct Concerns

If something has happened to make you feel unsafe, unwelcome, or excluded, or if you observe behavior that appears to make others feel unsafe, unwelcome, or excluded, please speak to your supervisor. They can help you determine the appropriate course of action to resolve the problem. We encourage you to speak to your supervisor as soon as possible so that the situation can be addressed promptly.
