# 18F Code of Conduct

This repository contains the official [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) of [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) (a digital delivery team within the [General Services Administration](http://gsa.gov)).

**[Read 18F's Code of Conduct.](code-of-conduct.md)**

### Reporting

18F staff who are being mistreated in 18F spaces should report the issue to their supervisor. If they are uncomfortable speaking to their supervisor, GSA employees also have the option to raise their concerns with talent team director Jen Tress, the [Office of Human Resources Management](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/21403), or the [Office of Civil Rights](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/101013). This code of conduct is not intended to limit your rights as established in law and GSA policy. If you are not a member of the 18F team, any member of the team can put you in touch with any of the above points of contact.
